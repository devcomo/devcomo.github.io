<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Amazon Web Services - Ted Han</span></span></strong></p>


<p><strong>Ted Han (</strong><span style=""><a href="https://twitter.com/knowtheory">@knowtheory</a>) is going to talk about some of the work he has done using Amazon Web Services at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/home">DocumentCloud</a>. &nbsp;Here is the gist:</span></p>


<blockquote>
<p><span style="">DocumentCloud hosts its servers through Amazon Web Services. &nbsp;The</span><br style="" /><span style="">choice of AWS along side some architecture constraints has allowed</span><br style="" /><span style="">DocumentCloud to respond to unexpected demand with very little</span><br style="" /><span style="">additional work. &nbsp;And where additional work has been necessary AWS&#8217;s&nbsp;</span><span style="">APIs have allowed us to provision resources quickly and easily. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll&nbsp;</span><span style="">be doing a quick overview of AWS and the features that DocumentCloud&nbsp;</span><span style="">has relied upon.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>A little more about Ted:&nbsp;<span style="">&nbsp;He is a l</span><span style="">inguist by degree, software developer by trade and a scifi &amp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">video game nerd by leisure. &nbsp;Visit his blog at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://blog.knowtheory.net/" target="_blank" style="">http://blog.knowtheory.net/</a>.</p>


<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Finding Niche Networks - Scott Wendling</span></span></strong></p>


<p><strong>Scott Wendling</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="http://twitter.com/commercialscott">@commercialscott</a>) from&nbsp;<a href="http://penguinspark.com">PenginSpark Social Marketing</a>&nbsp;talk about finding niche networks. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s what he has to say about his talk:</p>


<blockquote>
<p><span style="">New social networks are popping up everyday. Networks for pictures, videos, bookmarking, gaming, and even networks to promote networks. Finding the niche network that fits you can have huge benefits to your overall networking and marketing. But choose the wrong one and you waste valuable time. Learn how to filter the noise and identify the networks that will work best for you.&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>A little more about Scott:&nbsp;<span style="">He is a social media logistics expert that implements and manages social marketing for companies. He uses a symbiotic approach that integrates and builds upon existing marketing strategies. In addition to consulting businesses he manages social media aspects of political campaigns, provides classes for state associations, and coordinated the &#8216;#CoMoFlashmob&#8217; for the Google Fiber to the Home competition.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><strong>Come join us on the 15th!</strong> We will have a good mix of topics and it is a great place to meet up with web developers, designers, and entrepreneurs in Columbia.</p>

<blockquote>Hacks/HackersIRE welcomes <a href="http://ashkenas.com/">Jeremy Ashkenas</a> to town to talk (q&amp;a style) about his work on DocumentCloud, as well as some higher level discussion on software for a civic cause. We&#8217;ll also do some introductions and some game type things just as a way to spark conversation between the Hacks (journalists) and Hackers (devs). People are of course more than welcome to come and leave as they please (we are hosting the meetup at a bar after all!).</blockquote>


<div>Things kick off at 7pm at the <a href="http://www.broadwaybrewery.com/">Broadway Brewery</a>, Wed Sept 21st.</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>So this month you can get a triple dose of technology.

<p>This month we&#8217;ll have a smattering of presentations on some of the popular NoSQL databases out there that should give you a good idea of what is out there that you can quickly dump MySQL (or egads! Oracle!) for. :)</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s the night&#8217;s lineup:</p>


<p>Clint Shryock will give a talk on <a href="http://www.basho.com/products_riak_overview.php" title="Riak">Riak</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Ben Griffith will discuss <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" title="MongoDB">MongoDB</a> (which my smart phone always corrects as Mongolian ER).</p>


<p>Brian Cooksey will give rundown on <a href="http://redis.io/" title="Redis">Redis</a>.</p>


<p>Finally, James Carr will give an overview of <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/" title="CouchDB">CouchDB</a></p>


<p>Whew&#8230; that&#8217;s a lot of talks. And each of them are clocked in at 90 minutes each! Just kidding&#8230; they&#8217;re not going to be anywhere near that long and it should be an interesting foray into the different NoSQL databases available for use in your projects.&nbsp;</p>


<p>This month&#8217;s meetup will be held at Museao and as the same with last month you&#8217;re welcome to show up around 5:30 for drinks, casual discussion and socialization with the meetup officially beginning at 6pm.&nbsp;</p>


<p>As always, we&#8217;ll have a few give aways from our sponsors, from print books, ebooks, intelliJ licenseses and much more! Just remember to tweet #comorichweb in the days leading up to the meetup.&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; border-collapse: collapse;">If you haven&rsquo;t heard, Startup Weekend is coming to Columbia and will<br />be a great event for anyone interested in startups particularly web<br />and mobile apps.<p />The weekend is basically a 54 hour mad dash where developers,<br />designers, and other product people get together, come up with an<br />idea, form a team and build a product/prototype for a web or mobile or<br />some other web related venture. I went to the one in KC this spring<br />and had a lot of fun.<p />It would be a great place to test out an idea, try a new technology,<br />or work with someone new.<p />The event will be hosted at the Museao Building on Sept 30-Oct 2. Get<br />more info here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.columbia.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #074d8f;">www.Columbia.StartupWeekend.org</a><p />Since we are a tech user group we can use the discount code &ldquo;CoMO&rdquo; for<br />15% off the ticket price if you register before the early bird<br />deadline on August 31. So for less than $70 you get free food and<br />drinks for the whole weekend, access to great speakers, and get to<br />compete to win some cool prizes (cash, AWS credits, Twilio credits,<br />and more). The competition takes place the last night and is based on<br />the startup that you create with your team during the weekend.<p />If you have any questions post them on the list and I&rsquo;ll try to answer<br />them as best I can, otherwise sign up before the early bird deadline<br />on the 31st. Space is limited so sign up early or risk not getting in.</span></p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The time is upon us and<strong> Wednesday July 27th</strong> is the next comorichweb meetup. This month we&#8217;ll be meeting up at our usual <a href="http://comorichweb.posterous.com/pages/about">Carfax</a> location and we have a few short talks lined up. To start things off Roger Webb will be giving a presentation on <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony2</a>. After that James Carr (that&#8217;s me!) will share some of his experiences developing a web application using serverside <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">coffeescript</a>&nbsp;with examples. Finally, there&#8217;s some time for open discussion and lightning talks as both talks are scheduled to be short in length&#8230; I know Clint has had tons of good tips and tricks on git to share with us amongst other things. :)&nbsp;</p>


<p>As always, we have a few items up for raffle from our sponsors.</p>


<ul>
<li>A JetBrains License good for any of thier products</li>
<li>Two O&#8217;Reilly Books (HTML5 and Javascript Design Patterns)</li>
<li>E Book coupons</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, I&#8217;ve come into a ton of Atlassian starter licenses that are due to expire, so all attendees who want one will get one. See you there! ;)</p>
