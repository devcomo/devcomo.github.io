<h2>Building Touch Apps with Web Technologies</h2>
<h3>By: Luke Daffron</h3>
<p>About the talk:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">If you are already familiar with HTML5, Javascript, and JQuery &ndash; you have most of the tools you need to write &ldquo;native&rdquo; apps for iOS and Android.  If nothing else, it can help you build a really fast cross-platform prototype or V1.   I&rsquo;ll take you through how I developed an app with <strong>JQuery Mobile</strong> and <strong>PhoneGap Build</strong>, and share some tips along the way.</blockquote>
<p><p /></p>
<h2>Task Queues in Python, Ruby and More!</h2>
<h3>By: Bryan Helmig</h3>
<p>About the talk:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Task Queues are efficient ways to perform important things in the background instead of introducing delays for the user. Primarily, we&rsquo;ll cover identifying use cases and architecture, but we&rsquo;ll also dig down into Python&rsquo;s Celery, Ruby&rsquo;s Resque, and touch on some simple &ldquo;home grown&rdquo; queue systems.</blockquote>

<p>James Carr will be presenting on rabbitMQ, messaging patterns, and why using databases for messaging generally sucks.&nbsp;</p>


<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Haddop and HBase for Managing Big Data</strong></span></span></span></p>


<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">First up we have John Riley, Principal Consultant of <a href="http://www.inciteretail.com/">Incite Retail</a>&nbsp;who will be sharing with us his experiences with<strong> Haddop and HBase for Managing Big Data</strong>:</span></p>


<blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Big Data quite simply swamps Traditional database &amp; Data Warehouse architectures. In the Big Data age now breaking upon us, the sheer volume, velocity, and variety of information content now operant in the application space required a new class of technologies and approaches. &nbsp;Hadoop &amp; Hbase have arrived, been put to long use and tested under the most stringent conditions by major social media &amp; retail concerns.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><strong>John Riley</strong> brings decades of engineering and consulting experience in aerospace, manufacturing, healthcare, biotechnology, and finance from engagements in the US and Europe.  Prior to Incite Retail, John worked at Elan Pharmaceuticals developing work flow and data processing pipelines on large datasets. Currently, John provides thought leadership in the consulting practice focusing on data transformation, modeling, and serialization of data into Hadoop, HBase, and Hive.</span></p>


<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Backbone.js at Zapier</strong></span></span></p>


<p>And then after all the heavy hitting Hadoop and Big Data talk Mike Knoop will give a bit of a lighter talk on <strong>Backbone.js at Zapier</strong>:</p>


<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Backbone.js is a javascript micro-framework which really propels the idea of &ldquo;web apps&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;web pages&rdquo;. At Zapier, we are using Backbone and similar technologies to write a fast, modular, &nbsp;and complex frontend system which our customers use to create and interact with Zaps. Our frontend is constantly challenged to convey the complex notion of linking business web applications together using APIs &#8211; and we are using Backbone to achieve that goal. Other talking points include Backbone SEO, Backbone performance, Backbone architecture guidelines and using Backbone with RequireJS.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Mike Knoop</strong> is a Mechanical Engineering graduate student at the University of Missouri. From Wildwood, Missouri, he moonlights as a co-founder of Zapier hacking on Backbone, Cofeescript, and Sass. In past lives he has been seen as a Facebook Forum Moderator, writer for InsideFacebook.com, and Z80 assembly programmer for the TI-83/84 calculator series.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; background-color: #eeeeee;">Come join us on the 21st!</strong><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; background-color: #eeeeee;">&nbsp;We will have a good mix of topics and it is a great place to meet up with web developers, designers, and entrepreneurs in Columbia.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Amazon Web Services - Ted Han</span></span></strong></p>


<p><strong>Ted Han (</strong><span style=""><a href="https://twitter.com/knowtheory">@knowtheory</a>) is going to talk about some of the work he has done using Amazon Web Services at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/home">DocumentCloud</a>. &nbsp;Here is the gist:</span></p>


<blockquote>
<p><span style="">DocumentCloud hosts its servers through Amazon Web Services. &nbsp;The</span><br style="" /><span style="">choice of AWS along side some architecture constraints has allowed</span><br style="" /><span style="">DocumentCloud to respond to unexpected demand with very little</span><br style="" /><span style="">additional work. &nbsp;And where additional work has been necessary AWS&#8217;s&nbsp;</span><span style="">APIs have allowed us to provision resources quickly and easily. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll&nbsp;</span><span style="">be doing a quick overview of AWS and the features that DocumentCloud&nbsp;</span><span style="">has relied upon.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>A little more about Ted:&nbsp;<span style="">&nbsp;He is a l</span><span style="">inguist by degree, software developer by trade and a scifi &amp;&nbsp;</span><span style="">video game nerd by leisure. &nbsp;Visit his blog at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://blog.knowtheory.net/" target="_blank" style="">http://blog.knowtheory.net/</a>.</p>


<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Finding Niche Networks - Scott Wendling</span></span></strong></p>


<p><strong>Scott Wendling</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="http://twitter.com/commercialscott">@commercialscott</a>) from&nbsp;<a href="http://penguinspark.com">PenginSpark Social Marketing</a>&nbsp;talk about finding niche networks. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s what he has to say about his talk:</p>


<blockquote>
<p><span style="">New social networks are popping up everyday. Networks for pictures, videos, bookmarking, gaming, and even networks to promote networks. Finding the niche network that fits you can have huge benefits to your overall networking and marketing. But choose the wrong one and you waste valuable time. Learn how to filter the noise and identify the networks that will work best for you.&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>A little more about Scott:&nbsp;<span style="">He is a social media logistics expert that implements and manages social marketing for companies. He uses a symbiotic approach that integrates and builds upon existing marketing strategies. In addition to consulting businesses he manages social media aspects of political campaigns, provides classes for state associations, and coordinated the &#8216;#CoMoFlashmob&#8217; for the Google Fiber to the Home competition.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><strong>Come join us on the 15th!</strong> We will have a good mix of topics and it is a great place to meet up with web developers, designers, and entrepreneurs in Columbia.</p>

<h3>Talks</h3>


<p><a href="http://briangrinstead.com">Brian Grinstead</a>&nbsp;will be talking about Chrome Developer tools, covering a brief overview of modern in-browser debugging and inspecting, then dig into some of the tricks that can save a lot of time when working with html/css/javascript.</p>

There are some really neat features here, like LINQ.

<p>This month we&#8217;re going to have a few of the developers who participated in Startup Weekend share their experiences, technology stack, and how to get a functional prototype up and running within a weekend. We also have a few lightning talks lined up if time allows.</p>


<p>This month we&#8217;ll have our raffle again with ebook certificates from O&#8217;Reilly and Manning as well as JetBrains licenses. Just tweet #comorichweb to be eligible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>There&#8217;s a new group in town called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackshackersIRE/events/33435642/">Hacks/HackersIRE</a> that will have it&#8217;s first meetup on the 21st. Here&#8217;s a short blurb describing the first meetup:&nbsp;</div>


<blockquote>Hacks/HackersIRE welcomes <a href="http://ashkenas.com/">Jeremy Ashkenas</a> to town to talk (q&amp;a style) about his work on DocumentCloud, as well as some higher level discussion on software for a civic cause. We&#8217;ll also do some introductions and some game type things just as a way to spark conversation between the Hacks (journalists) and Hackers (devs). People are of course more than welcome to come and leave as they please (we are hosting the meetup at a bar after all!).</blockquote>


<div>Things kick off at 7pm at the <a href="http://www.broadwaybrewery.com/">Broadway Brewery</a>, Wed Sept 21st.</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>So this month you can get a triple dose of technology. First <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a> conference in St. Louis, Hacks/HackersIRE on the 21st, and then ComoRichweb <a href="http://comorichweb.posterous.com/next-meetup-nosql-smackdown-september-28th">NoSQL Smackdown</a> on the 28th!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Summer is over, school is back in session, and soon our next ComoRichWeb meetup will be upon us starting at 5:30 Wednesday September 28th at <a href="http://www.museao.com/" title="Museao">Museao</a>.</p>


<p>This month we&#8217;ll have a smattering of presentations on some of the popular NoSQL databases out there that should give you a good idea of what is out there that you can quickly dump MySQL (or egads! Oracle!) for. :)</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s the night&#8217;s lineup:</p>


<p>Clint Shryock will give a talk on <a href="http://www.basho.com/products_riak_overview.php" title="Riak">Riak</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Ben Griffith will discuss <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" title="MongoDB">MongoDB</a> (which my smart phone always corrects as Mongolian ER).</p>


<p>Brian Cooksey will give rundown on <a href="http://redis.io/" title="Redis">Redis</a>.</p>


<p>Finally, James Carr will give an overview of <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/" title="CouchDB">CouchDB</a></p>


<p>Whew&#8230; that&#8217;s a lot of talks. And each of them are clocked in at 90 minutes each! Just kidding&#8230; they&#8217;re not going to be anywhere near that long and it should be an interesting foray into the different NoSQL databases available for use in your projects.&nbsp;</p>


<p>This month&#8217;s meetup will be held at Museao and as the same with last month you&#8217;re welcome to show up around 5:30 for drinks, casual discussion and socialization with the meetup officially beginning at 6pm.&nbsp;</p>


<p>As always, we&#8217;ll have a few give aways from our sponsors, from print books, ebooks, intelliJ licenseses and much more! Just remember to tweet #comorichweb in the days leading up to the meetup.&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>See you there!</p>
