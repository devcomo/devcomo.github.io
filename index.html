<h3>Ian graves</h3>

<p>Reviewing the Latest Rails Vulnerability, CVE-2013-0333 and Friends</p>

The Rails framework was recently revealed to have a critical
vulnerability that allowed for remote code execution on the server.
Many commonly used iterations of Rails have been shown to have
security issues because of these findings.  This talk will step
through what makes Rails vulnerable and how an exploit would work.
It&#8217;s fair to expect a demo that includes a vulnerable Rails
distribution, Metasploit, and cursing by Ian when it doesn&#8217;t work
perfectly.

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Our Group Name Has Changed To dev/como</h2>

<p>After some discussion on our mailing list, we have decided to rename <strong>ComoRichWeb</strong> to <strong>dev/como</strong>!  Or, more formally, DevCoMO.</p>

<p>The primary reason is that we have a variety of developers in town, and not all of them are focused on web development.  We want to promote the group to any local developers, not exclusively to web devs.</p>

<h2>New Website</h2>

<p>We are also ditching our <a href="http://comorichweb.posterous.com/">old posterous site</a> and moving forward with our new, shiny Octopress site here at <a href="http://devcomo.com">http://devcomo.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Our Plan Going Forward</h2>

<p>We are going to be working hard to get the word out and make necessary changes.  We think it will be worth it as we try to broaden our appeal to developers in the mid Missouri area in the future.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things we are planning on doing in the near future:</p>

<ul>
<li>Working on a new logo.  Jerel did a great job with the ComoRichWeb logo, which actually still kind of fits, but we will probably be looking to make some kind of change to show the new name.</li>
<li>Updating our social presences, on <a href="http://twitter.com/ComoRichWeb">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/106712905654295354900">Google+</a>, <a href="https://github.com/organizations/CoMoRichWebGroup">Github</a>, and our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comorichweb">mailing list</a>.</li>
<li>Updating the web site to show more relevant news and information about our speakers and sponsors.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How You Can Help</h2>

<ul>
<li>Help get the word about the group out with other developers and designers in town.</li>
<li>Come to our meetups (like <a href="http://devcomo.com/blog/2013/01/01/january-2013-refactoring-and-local-startup-bo/">tonight&rsquo;s</a>) and help grow our community.  We are always open to suggestions on ways that we can make the group better.</li>
<li>Our new website could use some help and ideas as we build it out further.  Come talk to me at the meetup or send a message if you are interested in this.</li>

<h2>Local Startups - BottlCap - Social Jukebox App</h2>


<h3>Ryanne Dolan</h3>


<p>Continuing our series of showcasing Missouri startups and the technology they are being powered with, we will learn about&nbsp;<a href="http://bottlcap.com/">BottlCap</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://twitter.com/bottlcap">@BottlCap</a>).</p>


<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">BottlCap is developing a location-aware social jukebox app. We&#8217;ll present the tech that makes it possible. FeedGraph is the backend for the apps. The best way to describe the project is a read-write version of Facebook&#8217;s Graph API. The API is generic enough to support everything we need across all the apps. It uses a highly scalable real-time architecture built on Amazon&#8217;s EC2, S3, et al.</blockquote>


<p>Ryanne is a CS PhD student and instructor. BottlCap is Brad Siegler (CEO), Tony Patrick, and John Schultz.</p>


<h2>(Not) Refactoring Considered Harmful</h2>


<h3>Tyler Pickett</h3>


<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Refactoring is an essential part of the modern TTD development process. By taking advantage of the protection afforded by automated testing we can improve the readability and maintainability of our code while maintaining its functionality.</blockquote>


<p>Tyler Pickett is a Missouri native who came to Columbia to attend MU in the Mechanical Engineering Department in 2003. After completing a BS and the course work for a MS he joined Research to Practice developing a Rails app. You can find him at&nbsp;<a href="https://twiter.com/tpickett66">@tpickett66</a>&nbsp;or<a href="https://github.com/tpickett66">https://github.com/tpickett66</a>.</p>
